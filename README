sudowrt is a set of scripts and files that we were using to flash sudomesh settings onto APs. It is mostly deprecated, although it might help some other folks to quickly get a set of config files and packages onto a node without having to build a custom firmware. For the current sudomesh firmware image generator see sudomesh/openwrt-firmware.


This repository contains all of the files that differ from default OpenWRT. 

It also includes two scripts:

  flash_router.sh: Flashes your router with OpenWRT
  remote_install.sh: Turns your OpenWRT router into a sudowrt router.

This is not the recommended way of installing onto routers for deployment. Rather, it is a way for developers to get started quickly. 

The scripts make the following assumptions:

  That the computer running the scripts have wget and tftp installed.

  That you are installing OpenWRT Attitude Adjustment 12.09
 
  That your router is a Ubiquiti Picostation 2.

  (Yes. We agree that this last one sucks. 
   Please feel free to improve these scripts.)

How do use the scripts:

1. Run the flash_router script as root:

  sudo ./flash_router.sh

5. Run the remote_install script:

  ./remote_install.sh

The scripts will guide you through the entire process.

After you've done the remote install, you'll want to set up the networking rules:

  /etc/init.d/meshrouting
  /etc/init.d/tunneldigger


Happy Hacking!
